\chapter*{Abstract}
Metadata, or data about data, refers to information that provides structured context and details about other data. In the context of scientific publications, metadata can facilitate the discovery process of those publications and help researchers in exploring the enormous landscape of scientific literature.\\
In this thesis, we delve into the exploration of techniques for the extraction and parsing of essential metadata, such as article authors and references, from scientific publications. We propose our novel and effective approach to extract metadata both from the article itself and from the references within the publication.\\
Our tool, BiBEx, is designed to accurately extract metadata from both historical and contemporary scholarly literature, encompassing texts in both English and German. To accomplish this, we curated two distinct datasets: one dedicated to document segmentation and the other focused on reference segmentation and parsing.\\
Our results demonstrate that BiBEx achieves comparable or slightly improved performance when compared to commonly used tools for metadata extraction in scientific literature.
